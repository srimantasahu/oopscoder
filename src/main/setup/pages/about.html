<h3>Who I Am</h3>
Iâ€™m <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/srimantasahu/">Srimanta Sahu</a>, a passionate Java developer with over 12 years of experience in building scalable, high-performance systems, primarily in the banking and fintech domains. Iâ€™ve led the development of low-latency trading platforms at J.P. Morgan Chase, working with real-time integrations such as Bloomberg and MarketAxess.

With a strong background in Java, Spring Boot, multithreading, system design, and distributed architectures, I created this platform to share real-world knowledge and hands-on coding practices that can benefit both aspiring and professional developers.
